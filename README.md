# Exploring European Soccer Data With SQL

Looking at their form, their goal scoring and other relevant metrics that can be used to paint a broad picture of their performance in that league season. 

## Data Source and Description
The data used for this project was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer). The database contains +25,000 matches, +10,000 players, 11 European Countries with their lead championship, seasons 2008 to 2016, detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etcâ€¦) for +10,000 matches and so on.
